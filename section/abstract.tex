Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log proposed by D.~Ongaro and J.~Ousterhout.
One of its key aspects is being designed to be easily understood.
D.~Ongaro also created a simulator called Raft Scope in order to visualize and present it.
This tool currently implements the protocol only in its basics.
In this work we extend its capabilities to support new features
and we enhance the user interface to help clarify the more complex aspects of the protocol.
