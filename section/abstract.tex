Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log by Ontaro and Ousterhout.
One of its key aspect is to be designed for understandability.
The protocol author provides a simulator to visualize/understand/present it.
Such tool implements the protocol only in its basics.
In this work we extend its capabilities to support the all the features,
and we enhance the GUI to help clarify few deeper protocol aspects.
