In this work we completed a great and useful simulator for the Raft protocol.

In particular we implemented the cluster change functionalities and
we simplified and clarified the user interface enabling simpler understanding
of all aspects of the algorithm and its corner cases.

To contribute to this complex simulation tool, we needed to first master the
Raft protocol to be able then to understand the simulation mechanism.

We hope our work will easy the learning curve for others to come,
as the original Raft Scope did for us.
