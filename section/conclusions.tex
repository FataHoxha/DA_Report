With this work we completed a great and useful simulator for the Raft protocol.
In particular we implemented the cluster changing functionalities;
we also simplified and completed the GUI to allow the understanding of all
the algorithm aspects and corner case.
We (re-)learned the importance of questioning ourselves about the correctness
of what we are reading.
Modify the simulation model required us to master the Raft algorithm to fully
comprehend the model itself.

We hope our work will easy the learning curve for the others to come,
as the original Raft Scope did partially for us.
