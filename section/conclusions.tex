This project helped us learn how Raft works because we had to understand 
how the model and simulation are structured in order to make improvements.

In particular we implemented the cluster change functionalities,
we simplified and clarified the user interface to allow the understanding of all
aspects of the algorithm and corner cases.

We hope our work will easy the learning curve for others to come,
as the original Raft Scope did for us.
